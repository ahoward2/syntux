## ‚òïÔ∏è Summary

The `Readonly<Type>` utility type constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to `readonly` where the properties of the newly constructed type cannot be
reassigned.

Continuing on with our guide through utility types, we're going to create another function called `freezeUser` that will freeze
an object with the JavaScript `Object.freeze()` method and return a user object with `readonly` properties.

## üõ† How It Works

So, let's take a look at the `freezeUser` function we've created.

```typescript
// User.tsx

export function freezeUser(user: User): Readonly<User> {
  Object.freeze(user);
  return user;
}
```

We take in a parameter `user` of type `User` and the return type of the function is `Readonly<User>` which is a newly constructed `User` with
all properties set to `readonly`. This means that it is `readonly` to the **Typescript compiler**, so the compiler will warn us if we attempt
to reassign any of the properties.

Also, in the `freezeUser` function, we use Object.freeze()
and return the frozen object which also will not update
the age of user4 at runtime.

```typescript
// App.tsx

let user4 = freezeUser(user3);

user4.age = 55;
// Cannot assign to 'lastName' because it is a read-only property.
```

But then what if we reassign user4 to a new object that is not frozen, yet still readonly?

Let's re-use the `updateUser` function from the [first guide for using the Partial utility type](https://www.icycoder.com/posts/utility-types-partial) ‚Üó which
will reassign user4 to an object that is no longer frozen.

```typescript
// App.tsx

// Now we're reassigning user4 to a new object that is returned
// from the updateUser() function which means it's no longer frozen.
user4 = updateUser(user4, { firstName: "Alien" });

user4.lastName = "Musk";
// Cannot assign to 'age' because it is a read-only property.
```

We still get the compiler warning us that user4.lastname is read-only but this still does not stop that value of those properties from changing at run-time though.
The UI will still update the value at runtime.

## üß† Quiz Question

Given an interface `Block` with 2 properties `hash` and `message`:

```typescript

interface Block = {
  hash: string;
  message?: string;
};
```

If we wanted to define a new type `StrictBlock` with `Readonly<Block>` like this:

```typescript
type StrictBlock = Readonly<Block>;
```

Which of the following is true of `StrictBlock`?

<div>
  <QuizGenerator
    answerChoices={[
      "The value of any property of StrictBlock can be changed at runtime",
      "StrictBlock is frozen so can't be changed at runtime",
      "All properties of StrictBlock are required",
    ]}
    correctAnswerIndex={0}
  ></QuizGenerator>
