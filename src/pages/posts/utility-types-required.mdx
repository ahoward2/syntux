## ‚òïÔ∏è Summary

The `Required<Type>` TypeScript _utility type_ constructs a new type consisting of all properties of `Type` set to required.
If you're following the TypeScript utility types guide, this is the opposite of [Partial](https://www.icycoder.com/posts/utility-types-partial) ‚Üó

Let's continue with our user updating function that uses `Partial<Type>` in code sandbox. If you haven't followed the guide from
the beginning, go back to [Partial](https://www.icycoder.com/posts/utility-types-partial) ‚Üó

We can make a new function to create a user and the `Required` type is perfect for this!

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Code Sandbox Example

<div style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/typescript-required-utility-type-7sdfo?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
    style={{
      width: "100%",
      height: "500px",
      border: "0",
      borderRadius: "4px",
      overflow: "hidden",
    }}

</div>

## üõ† How It Works

Since we're making a function that will create a new user, we want to make sure the shape of the data matches the `User`
interface.

```typescript
// User.tsx

export function createUser(user: Required<User>) {
  return { ...user };
}
```

When calling the `createUser` function, again, we must pass in every property or T.S. will warn us.

```typescript
// App.tsx

const user1 = createUser({
  firstName: "Vitalik",
  lastName: "Buterin",
  age: 27,
  favoriteSongs: [
    "Hold On - Moxura",
    "Pressure - Martin Garrix",
    "Run It Up - Lil Tjay",
  ],
});

const user2 = createUser({
  firstName: "Satoshi",
  lastName: "Nakamoto",
  age: 900,
  favoriteSongs: ["Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"],
});

let user3 = createUser({
  firstName: "Lex",
  lastName: "Fridman",
  age: 33,
  favoriteSongs: [
    "Rolling in the Deep - Adele",
    "All About That Bass - Meghan Trainor",
  ],
});

// updateUser function from  Partial<Type> Tutorial :)
user3 = updateUser(user3, { firstName: "Robot" });

const listOfUsers = [user1, user2, user3];
```

`Required<User>` will also make every property of `User` required even if it is set to optional (e.g.) `age?: number`

<Callout
  content="Note: This is really where required is useful, you're constructing a new type from a given type that already exists
and you can be confident that all properties are required regardless of the given types properties."

></Callout>

## üß† Quiz Question

Given a type `Group` with 2 _optional_ properties `groupName` and `members`:

```typescript
// User[] is an array of objects of type User from the interface we created

type Group = {
  groupName?: string;
  members?: User[];
};
```

If we wanted to define a new type `StrictGroup` with `Required<Group>` like this:

```typescript
type StrictGroup = Required<Group>;
```

Which of the following is true of `StrictGroup`?

<div>
  <QuizGenerator
    answerChoices={[
      "groupName will be the only optional property",
      "members will be the only optional property",
      "Both groupName and members will be optional properties",
      "All properties of StrictGroup are required",
    ]}
    correctAnswerIndex={3}
  ></QuizGenerator>
</div>
