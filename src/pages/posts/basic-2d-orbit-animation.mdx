# ‚òïÔ∏è Summary

---

In this guide, we create a basic orbital animation with pure HTML and CSS! ü™ê

Everything in here is actually 2-dimensional, but with a couple of handy CSS properties and functions, we can achieve something that looks pretty close to a satellite orbiting a spherical object in space.

To jump to the code and see what it looks like, just head to the bottom of the page. üëá

# üî¨ How It Works

---

With just a very small amount of HTML and CSS, we can simulate a fairly decent looking animation. There are a lot of excellent examples of 3-dimensional orbital animations out there on the internet. But if you actually wanted to ship something like this into an application in a production environment, you may want to use a more minimal approach like this to keep your pages fast.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HTML Code

---

The only HTML that we need for this example is a `body` for the black background, and two `<div>` elements that represent our planet and orbiter object.

```html
<body>
  <div class="planet"></div>
  <div class="orbiter"></div>
</body>
```

Very simple. üôÇ

## ‚öôÔ∏è CSS Code

---

There are a couple of key properties and functions that we'll be using in our CSS.

- `box-shadow` this property allows use to produce the inner shading color effects and the outer glowing effect for our planet.
- `@keyframes` allows us to create an animation sequence with translation functions.
- `animation` allows us to control the values of our animation.
- `transform: translateX` allows us to move the position of our satellite object horizontally across the screen.
- `scale` allows us to scale our satellite object to produce a perception of depth.

First, we set the background of our body element to black.

```css
body {
  background: black;
}
```

Then, we create our planet powered by the `box-shadow` property to produce that 3-dimension look.

```css
.planet {
  position: fixed;
  top: calc(50% - 150px);
  left: calc(50% - 150px);
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 50px #fff, inset 20px 0 80px #01b2ff,
    inset -20px 0 80px #8000ff, inset 20px 0 300px #00785c,
    inset -20px 0 300px #8300f5, 0 0 50px #00785c, -10px 0 80px #000278, 10px 0
      80px #8000ff;
}
```

Now, let's make a `@keyframes` animation sequence to produce the orbit.

Each percentage in the animation sequence defines the steps percent of time in respect to a total amount of time that we want the animation to take.

**For example:** if our animation lasted a total of 10 seconds, `20%` to `30%` would represent the step from 2s to 3s.

**How This Sequence Works:**

`0%` satellite object begins it's journey at the right side of the planet and starts as scaled down to 0% of it's total size (invisible). This makes it appear that the satellite has just emerged from behind the planet in it's orbital path.

`10%` satellite object travels 10 pixels to the right and scales up just slightly in order to appear that it's traveling on the z-axis (towards us).

`20%` satellite object travels 30 pixels to the left and scales up, but only by +0.05 percentage of it's total size.

Without explaining all of the rest of the steps in the sequence, you get an idea of how we're using `scale` and `translateX` to make our satellite appear that it's traveling on an orbital path.

All of these values can be fine-tuned and more steps in the sequence can produce a smoother animation.

```css
@keyframes orbit {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(150px) scale(0);
  }
  10% {
    transform: translateX(160px) scale(0.15);
  }
  20% {
    transform: translateX(130px) scale(0.2);
  }
  30% {
    transform: translateX(100px) scale(0.3);
  }
  40% {
    transform: translateX(60px) scale(0.35);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateX(0px) scale(0.4);
  }
  60% {
    transform: translateX(-60px) scale(0.35);
  }
  70% {
    transform: translateX(-100px) scale(0.3);
  }
  80% {
    transform: translateX(-130px) scale(0.2);
  }
  90% {
    transform: translateX(-160px) scale(0.15);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(-150px) scale(0);
  }
}
```

Now we just need to define the properties of our satellite `.orbiter`.

```css
.orbiter {
  position: fixed;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #fff;
  animation-name: orbit;
  animation-duration: 40s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
}
```

`animation-name` is where we can specify the sequence that we created for the orbit animation.

`animation-duration` is the total amount of time that we want our sequence to animate.

`animation-iteration-count` is the total number of times that we want our animation to execute.

`animation-timing-function` is the function that we want our function to follow.

That's everything we need! Doesn't look too shabby. üéâ

Now it's up to you to make it even better!
